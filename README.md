## Zombie Survivors
My first project, a game created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript using the Canvas API.

## Motivation
Although this was my first project assigned by my Instructor at the Per Scholas Software Engineering Course, I wanted to shoot high and make something I can be proud of, plus I really like vampire survivors.

## Features
Animated Sprites for walking and shooting, somewhat optimized collision detection.

## How to use?
Open in GitHub Page to play.
