## Zombie Survivors
My first project, a game created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript using the Canvas API.

## Motivation
Although this was my first project assigned by my Instructor at the Per Scholas Software Engineering Course, I wanted to shoot high and make something I can be proud of, plus I really like vampire survivors.

## Features
Animated Sprites for walking and shooting, zombie death animation, somewhat optimized collision detection, bgm, sfx, zombies can drop power up fruits.

## How to use?
Open in GitHub Page to play.

## To Be Implemented

## Known Bugs

Bullet Projectile Animation Improperly changing direction after being fired  
Sometimes when the game loads, the animations are at an improper speed, i suspect it's an asset loading problem again - THIS IS FIXED, IT WAS BECAUSE I FORGOT TO REMOVE THE PLAY GAME EVENTLISTENER SO IT RAN IT TWICE
